# **Brazilian Data Resources**<br/> 
I work with a wide range of administrative datasets from Brazil. I will post here useful data and cleaning scripts. Please feel free to make use of these resources, or reach out with questions, comments or suggestions through e-mail (ekatovich@wisc.edu) or [Github](https://github.com/ekatovich). <br/> 

**Recreate Brazil's Geodesic Offshore Projection Maps (Oil & Gas Royalty Distribution)**<br/> 
This repository contains R code, raw data, and supporting documentation to reconstruct orthogonal and parallel projections of state and municipal coastal boundaries used by Brazil's National Oil Agency to allocate offshore oil and gas revenues.

**ANP Oil Royalties and Special Participation Transfers to Municipalities (1999-2017)** <br/> 
This repository contains raw data and Stata code to build a balanced monthly panel of royalty and special participation transfers to Brazilian municipalities from 1999-2017.<br/>

**Municipality Name to Municipality/Microregion/Mesoregion/UF Code Crosswalk** <br/> 
This repository contains raw data and Stata code to attach Brazilian municipality names to 6 and 7 digit IBGE numeric municipality identifiers, as well as microregion, mesoregion, and state identifiers. This facilitates merges with datasets that report only municipality names. <br/>

**Useful Links** <br/> 
[Base dos Dados](https://basedosdados.org/)<br/> 
This is a major initiative to make Brazilian datasets available and accessible. New datasets are being cleaned and added every day. <br/> 

[Cleaning RAIS in Stata (1985-2018)](https://github.com/rdahis/clean_RAIS) <br/> 
[Ricardo Dahis](https://www.ricardodahis.com/) provides Stata code to clean the Relação Anual de Informações Sociais (RAIS), a matched employer-employee dataset with information on all formal establishments and workers in Brazil.  <br/> 

[geobr spatial datasets in R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geobr/vignettes/intro_to_geobr.html) <br/> 
The geobr package in R offers an easy way to download official Brazilian shapefiles.  <br/> 

[Crosswalk to create Minimum Comparable Areas for Brazilian Municipalities](https://sites.google.com/site/philippehrl/research) <br/> 
[Philipp Ehrl](https://sites.google.com/site/philippehrl/) has created Stata code to create "Minimum Comparable Areas" from Brazilian municipalities. These are coherent geographical units that take account of municipal splits and unions over different time periods.  <br/> 

[IPEA Data](http://www.ipeadata.gov.br/Default.aspx) <br/> 
IPEA makes available a large number of macroeconomic, social, and regional panel datasets for Brazil, many at the municipal level.  <br/> 

[Elections and Donation Data](http://www.tse.jus.br/eleicoes/estatisticas/repositorio-de-dados-eleitorais-1/repositorio-de-dados-eleitorais)<br/> 
Brazil's Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) publishes data on all federal, state, and municipal election candidates, parties, and donors, with some series going back to 1945.<br/> 

[Oil Sector Data](http://www.anp.gov.br/dados-abertos-anp)<br/> 
Brazil's National Oil Agency (ANP) makes available a huge variety of data on the country's oil sector, including royalties and production. <br/> 

[FOIA (Lei de Acesso à Informação)](https://sistema.ouvidorias.gov.br/publico/Manifestacao/SelecionarTipoManifestacao.aspx)<br/> 
Brazil's Information Access Law requires public agencies to respond to requests for public documents or data within 10 days. The system, which recently migrated from e-SIC to Fala.BR, works well. Simply create an account and submit your request (very clear and specific) to the appropriate institution. <br/>
