<div style="text-align: justify;">

Welcome! I’m a Research Economist in the Macroeconomic Analysis Division at [Banco de México](https://www.banxico.org.mx/indexen.html).<br/>

My research interests are in household and corporate finance and international macroeconomics. My current research focuses on understanding the role of liquidity in the behavior of distressed borrowers and studying the economic consequences of different financial shocks in the presence of financial frictions.<br/>

I earned a Ph.D. in Economics from the [University of Rochester](https://www.sas.rochester.edu/eco/graduate/index.html) in 2022.<br/>
